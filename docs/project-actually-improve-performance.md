# Project: Actually Improve Performance — the representation reset

**Status:** IN PROGRESS on the `reset/main` project branch (§6 branch policy).
- **Stage 0 — DONE, on master** (test pins `test_reset_pin_*`, scan sentinel, baselines appendix; plus
  the bare-record-map-value crash fix `650c07d5` it uncovered).
- **Stage 1 — DONE, on `reset/main`**: D5 share-on-push via 0xFD pointer-backed record arrays
  (all-scalar class); D3a anonymous-param monomorphisation (share-on-pass); D3b non-param slot
  project-copy. Side wins on master: the monomorphisation inner-closure LLVM symbol-collision fix
  (`b5ccb64b` — cured the long-standing cross-module generic worker-transfer crash). Stage-1 ledger:
  typed RAPTOR −4.7% vs baseline (digest exact), `records` ≡ master, scan sentinel ~1.9× (the §5.6
  lever remains available); suites green. The repr.rs boxed-arm removal was re-sequenced into Stage 2.
- **Stage 2 — IN PROGRESS**: leg 2a (heap-field record arrays → 0xFD) hit the documented
  `{String: T[]}` map-value seam; direction decided: the `??` coalesce join PRESERVES Packed for
  sealed arrays (hot path stays 0xFD-native) + generic LinArray runtime fns gain tag-dispatching
  0xFD arms via the named descriptor (sound safety net, 0xFE precedent). A record-taint/forced-Boxed
  pass was rejected (re-introduces the flow-sensitive reconciliation this project deletes).

## 0. One-paragraph thesis

Lin is slower than Go not because of a fundamental language tradeoff, and not (mostly) because of
backend immaturity, but because of **one early representation decision**: typed records were built
*on top of* the JSON runtime object (`LinObject` — a heap-allocated, refcounted, **string-keyed**
thing). Field access on a record therefore became a key lookup and an LLVM optimization barrier, even
when the field set is statically known, and the compiler grew a flow-sensitive representation-inference
pass (ADR-062) to *claw back* struct speed occurrence-by-occurrence — the origin of every "path-9"
dead end. The fix is along **two clearly separated axes**: a record's *representation* becomes a flat
packed struct with constant-offset access (the performance lever), while its *semantics* stay
**reference** — `val b = a` shares, `mutateObj(b)` mutating its parameter is still visible (no userland
behaviour change from the axis we keep). And the conflated JSON object is dissolved: dynamic data is
either a real **hashmap** (`{ String: T }`) or **`AnyVal`** (née `Json`), and `LinObject` ceases to
exist. The typed-vs-Go gap then closes as a *consequence* of drawing three clean lines — types,
hashmaps, and a dynamic value type — rather than as a perpetual fight.

## 0.5 Working design decisions (D1–D8 — the direction to implement against)

These resolve the design holes found in review and are the agreed **direction** the implementation
targets — not a frozen specification. **The order is implement-then-document:** we build against
D1–D8, let the details settle through implementation (they always shift), and write the authoritative
`SPECIFICATION.md` / ADR text *afterward* to match what was actually built. So treat D1–D8 as firm on
intent but provisional on detail; where implementation contradicts one, the implementation wins and
the decision is updated here, then ratified in the spec at the end (§6 closing work).

- **D1 — Representation vs semantics are separate axes.** Representation: records become flat packed
  structs (constant-offset access), required. Semantics: records stay **reference** types (Java/C#
  model — flat layout, O(1) fields, pointer-shared). Passing records to functions, `val b = a`
  aliasing, and in-place mutation through a parameter are **unchanged**.

- **D2 — `Json` → `AnyVal`, a single JSON-shaped value union, with NO opaque handles.**
  `AnyVal = Null | Bool | Int* | Float* | String | AnyVal[] | { String: AnyVal } | <any record>`.
  It is **value-shaped only**: it cannot hold a `Function`, `Iterator`, `Stream`, `Shared`, `Promise`,
  or `TarEntry`. There is **no** separate handle-carrying top type above it — handles stay statically
  typed and cannot be widened into `AnyVal`. This is deliberate: it preserves the gates that depend on
  the dynamic type being JSON-shaped (cross-thread transferability, the async-thunk return
  restriction, foreign-signature exclusions). The project goal is to **retire almost all uses of
  `AnyVal`** — most values currently typed `Json` get a precise type (a record, a hashmap, a union);
  `AnyVal` survives only as the genuine "unknown wire shape" escape hatch. (Naming note: it is called
  `AnyVal`, not `Any`, precisely because it is *not* a true top type — `print`/display/serialization
  accept `AnyVal`, the set of *displayable value shapes*, not anything-including-handles.)
  **Transitivity rule (closes the field-smuggling leak):** a record (or union) widens into `AnyVal`
  only if it is **transitively value-shaped** — every field/member is itself `AnyVal`-shaped. Records
  with `Function`/`Iterator`/opaque fields are legal today (§5.9.1 keeps them boxed), so without this
  rule a record with a `Function` field widened into `AnyVal` would smuggle a handle past every gate
  D2 exists to protect. Widening such a record is a compile-time error; the value stays statically
  typed.

- **D3 — Anonymous structural types: monomorphise at direct parameters, canonical-layout +
  project-copy everywhere else.** A function over `(r: { "type": String })` is specialised per
  caller's concrete record layout (offset of `type` may differ), exactly as generics already
  monomorphise — preserving sharing at direct call sites, which covers the userland uses found
  (e.g. `examples/processes/outcome.lin:21`). But monomorphisation cannot help the **non-parameter
  slots**: an array typed `{ "type": String }[]`, a record field, a map value, or a return type
  annotated with an anonymous shape can each receive values with heterogeneous concrete layouts, and
  one array needs one element layout. The general rule: **every anonymous structural type gets a
  canonical layout, and widening into any non-parameter slot project-copies** — i.e. §5.9.1's
  named-record projection extends to anonymous shapes at slot boundaries. Stored closures
  (`(Named) => _` invoked with heterogeneous layouts) take the same project-copy fallback. **This is
  itself a semantics change vs today** (spec §5.9 lets anonymous params receive wider values that
  share and keep their extra fields — the very thing §5.9.1's "Consequence" paragraph contrasts named
  records against), so it counts in the visible-change list (§7.2 #5). **Stage-0 probing scoped it
  further**: today the share-through-anon-slot behaviour only actually holds for **boxed** records;
  a **packed** wide record already materializes a copy at every anonymous boundary (param, array
  element, …) — so change #5 in practice only alters the boxed-record cases, and the packed cases
  already behave as the end-state prescribes for non-param slots. Probably rare in practice, but the
  rule and the count both say it.

- **D4 — The record↔`AnyVal` boundary is a defined single-direction conversion, not a reconciliation
  oracle.** `record → AnyVal` **carries the record pointer + its descriptor** (preserving reference
  semantics and aliasing through the dynamic boundary; **no** deep O(graph) hashmap conversion). This
  is the **v1** design, not a later optimization — it is the compatibility-preserving option, because
  converting to a `{String:AnyVal}` hashmap would sever the aliasing that widening-to-`Json` has today.
  `AnyVal → record` validates-and-projects (the §5.9.1 projection). There is no bidirectional
  packed-or-boxed oracle — that was the path-9 trap. (`PERFORMANCE.md`'s path-9 epitaph "each boundary
  is a materialize-or-leak seam" applied to a *reconciliation*; this is a one-way conversion.)

- **D5 — Aliasing is unified to share-always; this is a real, intended, observable change.** Today a
  packed-value array `push` **copies** the element (the measured PREP 3.67×; §2.4) while a boxed array
  `push` **shares** a pointer — so `push(arr, t); t["x"] = 5; arr[i]["x"]` already differs by
  representation. Unifying to one representation makes it consistently observe `5`. This is the better
  semantics (one representation, one behaviour), but it is a behaviour change and means **digest
  stability across stages is an *expectation*, not a guarantee** — a stage that breaks the RAPTOR
  digest may have found *this intended change*, not a bug. A directed test pins the intended behaviour.

- **D6 — `keys`/`values`/`entries` apply to hashmaps and `AnyVal`, not records.** A record has a
  fixed, statically-known field set; dynamic key enumeration uses a hashmap. `std/object` currently
  applies to any object; narrowing it to hashmaps/`AnyVal` is a visible change.

- **D7 — Descriptors are a KEPT runtime concept.** Deleting `LinObject` deletes string-keyed
  *storage*, but record field-name/offset **descriptors** remain (they already half-exist for sealed
  records) and drive: order-independent equality, `toString`/display, `is T`/`has T` after a value has
  been through `AnyVal`, `fromJson` validation, worker deep-copy, and JSON serialization. The "net line
  count goes down" claim (§3) is judged against this residual.

- **D8 — The boxed shadow survives for `AnyVal`-flowing records until Stage 6 (transitional); for
  records that are BOXED today its aliasing must keep wrapping the live buffer.** During Stages 1–5,
  `LinObject` still exists, so a record widened into a `Json`/`AnyVal` slot keeps a boxed/descriptor
  form until the `AnyVal` refounding (Stage 6). **Stage-0 probing corrected the premise here**:
  today's `Json`-widening aliasing is itself representation-dependent — a **boxed** record (unpackable
  field) widens by sharing the live object (mutation stays visible through the `Json` alias), but a
  **packed** record widens by **materializing a copy** (aliasing severed). So the transitional
  invariant is scoped to what is true: records that take the boxed form keep live-buffer sharing
  through Stages 1–5 (no introduce-then-revert wobble for them), while the packed-widening copy is
  simply one more instance of the D5 representation-dependent aliasing split, and flips to share at
  the D4 pointer-carrying boundary (Stage 6) as part of the same unification. Consequences owned
  plainly: Stages 1–5 keep a **scoped flow-sensitive pass** (which records flow into `AnyVal`), so
  the `repr.rs` deletion payoff is **back-loaded to Stage 6**; Stage 1's "removes the boxed-shadow
  arm" and §3's deletion list apply to non-`AnyVal`-flowing records until then.

The honest count of userland-visible changes is therefore **five** (§7.2): the `Json → AnyVal` rename,
ordered-iteration migration, `keys`/`values`/`entries` off records (D6), the aliasing unification
(D5), and anonymous-structural slot/closure widening now projecting like named records (D3).

## 1. Why we are here (the diagnosis)

### 1.1 What the measurements actually say

- **The typed scalar core is already at or above systems-language parity.** The `records`
  cross-language benchmark (sealed all-scalar structs, constant-offset field access) is **Lin 200 ms
  vs Rust 224 ms vs Go 624 ms** — Lin wins. The compilation model is not the problem.
- **Eager combinator chains beat Rust ~4×** (fused to a single zero-allocation loop). Not the problem.
- **A tracing GC would not help.** Measured (`LIN_NO_RC` ceiling): deleting *all* allocation + RC
  recovers ~0% on every workload. No workload is allocation-bound. RC stays.
- **The gap is concentrated at the typed-record representation boundary.** Fully-typed RAPTOR runs
  **1.96×** the `Json` port. The residual is per-access string-keyed materialization (reads), a copy
  cost on construct/regroup (value-layout-specific; §2.4), and generic closure call boundaries — all
  tracing back to the representation, not to reference semantics. See `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §2.
- **Not every workload is repr-bound — interp is not.** A direct op-cycle profile of the `interp`
  benchmark puts boxed-record reads at ~6%, box/unbox at ~4%, strings at ~0.5%; the bulk is the
  generated code's call/control-flow overhead. The representation reset helps interp only marginally —
  interp needs a separate call-cost/inlining project. This is scoped *out* of this document (it is the
  residual "call axis"), but recorded so the reset is not oversold as a universal fix.

### 1.2 The root cause

The runtime grew up around `LinObject`: a boxed, refcounted, **string-keyed** object — the carrier
for JSON. Typed records were implemented *as* `LinObject`s rather than *beside* them as structs. The
load-bearing consequence is one thing, not two:

> **A "record" and a "JSON object" were welded into a single string-keyed representation.** A *record*
> has fixed, statically-known fields and wants a struct (constant-offset access). A *hashmap* has
> dynamic string keys and wants a dictionary. Conflated into one boxed string-keyed object, field
> access is an association-list / hashed lookup and an LLVM optimization barrier — *even when the
> field set is known at compile time*.

Records *also* ended up with reference semantics because two bindings can hold the same `LinObject`
pointer. **This part is fine and we are keeping it** — reference semantics with a flat layout is the
Java/C# model and is fast. It was never the villain; the string-keyed representation was. The mistake
to undo is the conflation, not the sharing.

The representation-inference pass (ADR-062, `lin-ir/src/repr.rs`, ~1,500 lines) exists solely to
*recover* struct speed from the boxed default. It is the single largest source of implementation
complexity and the origin of every "path-9" dead end. With one flat representation per record, it
collapses to a layout calculator.

**Crucially, the target representation already exists.** `lin_sealed_alloc`
(`lin-runtime/src/sealed.rs`) already produces *exactly* the flat record §2.1 describes: a
heap-allocated struct with refcount@0, size@4, **descriptor pointer@8**, scalar fields inline at
fixed offsets, heap fields as owned-pointer slots. The project is therefore **not** "invent a new
representation" — it is: **promote the existing sealed struct from a conditional optimization with
copy semantics to the sole record representation with pointer-share semantics**, then retire the two
other forms (the `LinObject` boxed form for records, and the inline-stride array element form). Every
implementation stage in §6 is written in those terms.

*(Note on §5.9.1: the spec's "non-mutating projection" copies a value when it is narrowed to a record
type `T`, dropping extra fields. That is a field-dropping narrowing operation, compatible with either
value or reference assignment semantics — it does not mandate value semantics.)*

---

## 2. The target model

There are exactly these kinds of values. Nothing else. In particular there is **no boxed
string-keyed object**, and **no value type above `AnyVal`**.

| Kind | Type form | Representation | Semantics | Field/elem access |
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Scalar | `Int32`/`Float64`/`Bool`/… | inline machine value | value | n/a |
| String | `String` | refcounted byte buffer (handle) | reference | n/a |
| Array | `T[]` | pointer-backed buffer of `T` | reference | const-offset / deref |
| Hashmap | `{ String: T }` | hashed `LinMap` | reference | O(1) hash lookup |
| Record | `type P = {…}` / anon structural | **flat packed struct** (heap, pointer-shared) | **reference** | **constant-offset load** |
| Union | `A \| B`, `T \| Null` | tag word + payload (ptr, or nullable ptr) | follows member | `match … is T` → read payload at `T`'s layout |
| AnyVal | `AnyVal` (née `Json`) | tagged union over the value kinds + record-ptr+descriptor; see §2.5 | reference | dispatch on tag |
| Opaque handle | `Function`, `Iterator`, `Promise`, `Stream`, `Shared`, `Frozen`, `TarEntry` | nominal runtime handle | reference | n/a — **not** an `AnyVal` member |

The three lines the current design blurs, drawn sharply:

- **Types** (records) — fixed fields, **reference** semantics, **flat struct** layout, constant-offset access.
- **Hashmaps** (`{ String: T }`) — dynamic string keys, a real dictionary, O(1) lookup.
- **A dynamic value type** (`AnyVal`) — "I don't know the shape; dispatch at runtime and pay for it" —
  but JSON-shaped, so it cannot smuggle a handle.

### 2.1 The two axes, decided (D1)

- **Representation (required): records are flat packed structs.** A record is a pointer to a
  contiguous heap struct: scalar fields inline, heap fields (`String`, array, map, nested record) as
  8-byte owned pointer slots. Field access is **always** a constant-offset load. There is no boxed
  shadow (modulo the D8 transitional `AnyVal` path). This is the whole performance change.
- **Semantics (chosen): records are reference types.** Assignment and parameter passing **share** the
  pointer. `val b = a` makes `b` and `a` the same record; `mutateObj(b)` mutating its parameter is
  visible through `b`. Mutation writes through the shared pointer, visible to all aliases.

### 2.2 Why reference semantics here is fast *and* simpler

- **Constant-offset field access** through the pointer is the entire query-side win.
- **No correctness obligation on aliasing analysis.** Reference shares by default, so Perceus (§5.4)
  becomes a pure *optimization*, never a correctness requirement.
- **Share-into-collections is cheap.** Pointer-backed `T[]`/`{String:T}` make `push(routeArr, trip)` a
  pointer share — like the `Json` form, no copy. This dissolves the PREP "inherent regroup copy"
  (§2.4).

### 2.3 Arrays and maps are pointer-backed (and today there are THREE record-in-array forms)

Today a record stored in an array takes one of **three** forms, and the plan retires two of them:

1. **Boxed `LinObject` pointer** — the slow string-keyed form. Retired (Stage 6).
2. **Inline header-less payload at `data + idx*stride`** (`lin_sealed_array_alloc`,
   `codegen/mod.rs` array-literal path). This is where today's *copy-on-push* semantics live — and
   with them the 9C corruption class and the `object.get` write-back subtlety. **D5 (share-always)
   requires killing this form**: an inline element cannot honestly alias. Retired (Stages 1–2).
3. **Pointer to a flat sealed struct** — the target. `arr[i]["f"]` is deref + constant-offset;
   `arr[i]["f"] = v` writes the shared record in place; `push(arr, r)` retains and appends a pointer.

- `{ String: T }` likewise stores sealed-struct pointers as values; reads return the shared record.
- The key change from today's *boxed* arrays is **what the pointer points at** (flat struct, not
  string-keyed object); the key change from today's *inline* arrays is **sharing instead of copying**.
- **Named risk:** the inline-stride form (2) has better cache locality for scan-dense code than
  pointer-backing. The `records` headline bench is a single TCO-threaded record (not an array), so it
  is not directly exposed — but Stage 1 carries a directed all-scalar-record-array scan microbench,
  and if pointer-backing regresses it meaningfully, the §5.6 escape-analysis inline layout is promoted
  from "optional later" into the main plan.

### 2.4 What this does to the "inherent PREP copy" finding (and D5)

`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §2 records PREP's ~3.67× as an *inherent* copy cost. **That is inherent only
under value-semantics / inline-array layout.** Under reference + pointer-backed arrays, the regroup
shares a pointer — cheap. The flip side is **D5**: today, the *currently-packed* cases copy on `push`,
so unifying to share-always is an observable aliasing change (`push(arr,t); t["x"]=5; arr[i]["x"]`
flips to `5`). This is intended and better, but it is named as a behaviour change with a directed test,
and it is why digest stability across stages is an *expectation*, not a guarantee (§6 preamble).

### 2.5 `AnyVal` is a JSON-shaped dynamic value type (the `Json` dissolution) — D2, D4

`Json` is renamed and re-founded as **`AnyVal`** — a recursive **value** union:

```
AnyVal  =  Null | Bool | Int* | Float* | String | AnyVal[] | { String: AnyVal } | <any record>
```

- Its representation is the **tagged-union machinery you already have** (the tagged value / SumNode
  family, ADR-064), with the record case carried as **record pointer + descriptor** (D4). It is **not**
  a bespoke object, and it has **no opaque-handle case** (D2): an `AnyVal` can never hold a
  `Function`/`Iterator`/`Stream`/`Shared`/`Promise`/`TarEntry`.
- A *"JSON object"* with statically-unknown keys is a `{ String: AnyVal }` **hashmap**. There is no
  third thing.
- Index/field access on an `AnyVal` dispatches on the tag: hashmap → hash lookup; record → descriptor
  offset; array → index; otherwise the safe-access rule yields `Null`.
- The boundary (D4), the only place dynamic↔typed conversion happens:
  - **`T` → `AnyVal`**: carry the record pointer + descriptor. **Shares** the record (preserves
    reference semantics and aliasing through the boundary); no deep hashmap conversion. v1 design.
  - **`AnyVal` → `T`**: validating projection / `fromJson`-style construction (§5.9.1).
- `print`, display, and serialization accept **`AnyVal`** — the set of displayable value shapes — not a
  handle-carrying top type. JSON is purely a **wire format**: parsed into records/hashmaps/`AnyVal`,
  serialized out of them, never resident in memory.

### 2.6 The wrinkle: iteration order

The current "Json object" provides **insertion-ordered** key iteration, and a little code leans on it
(RAPTOR's `getQueue` keeps `Json` for the within-round tie-break; hash order broke the digest). When
the Json object is dissolved, that guarantee moves to an **explicit** ordered-map container (a linked
hashmap) for the few cases that need it, or those cases switch to a list of `(key, value)` pairs. One
of the five userland-visible changes.

---

## 3. What gets deleted (and what is kept — D7)

A *simplifying* rewrite. Net line count goes **down**, judged against the kept descriptor residual.

- `lin-runtime/src/object.rs` and `lin_object_get`'s string-keyed **storage + scan** — gone. Dynamic
  access is a hashmap O(1) lookup or an `AnyVal` tag dispatch (record case → descriptor offset).
- The reconciliation arms of `lin-ir/src/repr.rs` (the flow-sensitive packed-or-boxed oracle/verify).
  What remains is a *layout calculator*. (Fully realised at Stage 6 per D8.)
- `BoxKeepPacked` and the keep-packed-across-boundary machinery.
- The boxed-shadow paths in `lin-codegen/src/codegen/boxing.rs`, the per-access materialize in
  `data.rs`, and `sealed.rs`'s rebuild-from-boxed.
- Essentially the entire "path-9" problem space.

**KEPT (D7): record descriptors** — field-name/offset tables (already half-present for sealed records).
They drive equality (order-independent), `toString`/display, `is T`/`has T` after `AnyVal`, `fromJson`
validation, worker deep-copy, and JSON serialization. "Delete `object.rs`" means "replace string-keyed
storage with descriptor-driven walks," not "remove all runtime knowledge of field names."

---

## 4. What we are explicitly NOT changing (non-goals)

- **Userland record semantics on the reference axis are unchanged.** Passing, aliasing, in-place
  mutation through a parameter — identical to today. (The five visible changes are listed in §7.2.)
- **Memory management stays Perceus-style RC.** Measured not alloc-bound.
- **Concurrency stays share-nothing.** `AnyVal`'s no-handle rule (D2) keeps transferability intact.
- **Eager combinator fusion stays.** Already beats Rust; untouched.
- **The surface syntax is unchanged.** Braces mean a record when fields are known, a hashmap under a
  `{ String: T }` context.
- **interp's call-cost axis is out of scope** (§1.1) — a separate project.

---

## 5. Design details that need to be right

### 5.1 Record ↔ `AnyVal` boundary (D4)

`T → AnyVal` carries pointer + descriptor (shares, O(1)); `AnyVal → T` validates-and-projects. No deep
conversion, no oracle. Keep the typed path wide so values rarely become `AnyVal` at all.

### 5.2 Unions and `match` narrowing the *value*

With a single flat representation per record, `match x is T => …` narrows the **value/representation**:
the body reads the payload at `T`'s known layout, no re-projection. This deletes the
`Conn = Boarding | Transfer` / `Trip | Null` materialization seam. `T | Null` where `T` is a record
collapses to a **nullable pointer**.

### 5.3 Structural types — literals, parameters, and every other slot (D3)

- A literal `{ "x": 1, "y": 2 }` infers an anonymous structural record → flat struct (same as a named
  record), a hashmap under `{ String: T }` context, `AnyVal` under `AnyVal`.
- A **direct parameter** of anonymous structural type (`(r: { "type": String })`) is **monomorphised
  per concrete argument layout** (like generics) — each specialisation reads `type` at that caller's
  offset, preserving sharing at zero new conceptual cost.
- **Every other anonymous-structural slot** — array element type (`{ "type": String }[]`), record
  field, map value, return type, and **stored closures** invoked with heterogeneous layouts — uses the
  general rule: the anonymous type has a **canonical layout**, and widening into the slot
  **project-copies** (§5.9.1's named-record projection extended to anonymous shapes). One array, one
  element layout. This is visible change §7.2 #5: today such widenings share and keep extra fields;
  under the reset they project, exactly as named records already do.

### 5.4 Perceus is an optimization here, not a correctness requirement

Reference shares by default, so correctness never depends on move analysis. `rc_elide.rs` still pays:
reuse-in-place for dead record buffers; RC elision around borrows. Upside, never a blocker.

### 5.5 `keys`/`values`/`entries` apply to hashmaps and `AnyVal`, not records (D6)

A record's field set is fixed and known; dynamic enumeration uses a hashmap. `std/object`'s
enumeration narrows to hashmaps/`AnyVal`. One of the five visible changes.

### 5.6 The optional inline-array (value-layout) optimization

Where a `T[]` provably does not alias-escape its elements, lay them out contiguously (Go `[]T`) for
cache locality. Needs escape/uniqueness analysis; deferred — but **promoted into the main plan if the
Stage-1 scan microbench regresses** (§2.3 named risk); the route to closing the last constant on Go
for scan-dense code.

### 5.7 Cross-form equality during the D8 transition

While `LinObject` survives for `AnyVal`-flowing records (Stages 1–5), a flat sealed record and a boxed
record of the same type can meet: `flatRecord == boxedRecord` must hold (descriptor-driven structural
compare). `emit_eq` has packed-vs-boxed handling today, but this is exactly the seam that breaks
silently — it gets a directed test in Stage 0 and stays in every stage gate until Stage 6 removes the
boxed form.

### 5.8 `is T` on `AnyVal` is a structural descriptor walk, not pointer identity

Lin records are structurally typed, so `is T` after a value has been through `AnyVal` cannot compare
descriptor *identity* — a same-shaped record built elsewhere (different descriptor instance) must
still match. The descriptor carries field names + kinds, so `is T` is a **descriptor structural walk**
(names/kinds match `T`), with a fast path when the descriptor pointer is identical. Pinned here so
Stage 6a does not accidentally implement nominal matching.

---

## 6. Implementation plan (staged, gated)

The project in one sentence (§1.2): promote the existing sealed struct to the sole record
representation with pointer-share semantics, retiring the `LinObject` form and the inline-stride array
form. Stageable by record-shape. Reference semantics makes inline-contiguous record arrays
**optional** (§5.6): the win flows through pointer-backed arrays once records are flat (Stage 2).

**Branch policy (master never regresses):** stages land on the project branch **`reset/main`**, not
on `master`. Several stages are deliberate *enablers* that cost performance before the wins arrive
(Stage 1's pointer-backing regressed the §2.3 scan sentinel ~1.9× — the measured trigger for this
policy); `master` must not carry that interim state. `reset/main` merges to `master` only when the
benchmark suite is **net-positive vs master** — no benchmark worse without a larger compensating win
landed in the same merge (realistically: at/after Stage 2's RAPTOR gain). Behaviour-neutral pieces
(bug fixes, test pins, baselines, docs — e.g. all of Stage 0) land on `master` directly. `master` is
merged INTO `reset/main` regularly so the branch never drifts. The per-stage gate below applies to
every merge into `reset/main`; the net-positive rule additionally gates `reset/main → master`.

### Per-stage gate (every stage holds all of these before merge into `reset/main`)

- `cargo build --workspace && cargo test --workspace` — 0 failures.
- `lin test stdlib/ examples/` — full green.
- RAPTOR cross-language digest matches (`group=26203913 range=773022892 journeys=139`) — **expected,
  not guaranteed**: per D5, a stage may *intentionally* change the digest where the old behaviour
  depended on representation-specific aliasing; such a change must be matched by a flipped directed
  test (Stage 0 suite), never silently accepted.
- The Stage-0 directed-test suite passes in its expected state (each test pins either today's
  behaviour or the intended end-state, flipping at the stage that changes it).
- ASan clean; RSS (`VmHWM`) bounded/flat over a full RAPTOR run; `records` still beats Go; the
  all-scalar-record-array scan microbench within agreed bounds (§2.3 risk); RAPTOR trends toward Go;
  `lin fmt --check`.
- **`.lin-cache` stamp bump** whenever the stage changes `TypedModule`/IR serialization (known
  footgun: stale caches mask representation changes).

### Stage 0 — Direction sign-off, test pins, baselines (small; no production code, no spec)

Per implement-then-document, no spec/ADR edits here — the authoritative text comes in the closing
work, written against the as-built design.

- Sign off **D1–D8** (§0.5) as the working direction.
- **Directed tests, written FIRST as pins** (landed: the `test_reset_pin_*` suite in
  `crates/lin/tests/integration.rs`). Each asserts *today's probe-verified* behaviour where it will
  change, with the intended end-state documented beside it; the stage that changes it flips the
  assertion deliberately. The probes corrected two premises (D3/D8 notes in §0.5): today's sharing
  through anon slots AND through `Json`-widening only holds for **boxed** records — packed records
  already copy at those boundaries. As-built pins:
  - **D5 aliasing split**: packed-array `push` copies / `Json`-array `push` shares — Stage 1 flips
    the packed half to share-always.
  - **D8/D4 widening split**: packed record → `Json` copies / boxed record → `Json` shares; the
    boxed half holds through Stages 1–5 (wrap-not-copy), the packed half flips at the D4 boundary.
  - **D3 anon-slot split**: boxed wide record shares through anon param + anon array element; packed
    wide record copies at both — end-state: params share (monomorphised), non-param slots
    project-copy.
  - **D2 transitivity**: a record with a `Function` field widens into `Json` today; flips to a
    compile error at Stage 6.
  - **§5.7 cross-form equality**: typed (packed) record `==` structurally-equal `Json` object,
    order-independent — must hold at every stage.
- **Stage-0 discovery (fixed, not pinned): bare-record map values were broken on master.** A packed
  sealed record stored as a `{ String: T }` map *value* was keep-packed into the slot (TAG_OBJECT
  wrapping a sealed struct that is not a `LinObject`) while every read assumed a boxed object —
  `lin_object_get` read sealed bytes as a LinObject header: index-cap-underflow panic (heap-field
  records), silent abort (all-scalar), and the same for `??`-coalesce and named-narrow stores.
  Fixed conservatively per the reset's own direction: map record slots are **always materialized
  boxed** (`emit_map_set` restricts keep-packed to sealed *arrays*, which are real tag-dispatchable
  `LinArray`s and stay fast — the RAPTOR pattern); a narrowed bare-record read projects the boxed
  slot to a fresh sealed struct. Ownership balances via the existing materialize carve-out in
  `IndexSet` lowering (RSS flat at 10× store volume). Regression tests:
  `test_map_bare_record_value_*`.
- **Scan microbench** (landed: `benchmarks/record_array_scan.lin`): all-scalar-record-array
  iteration (today's inline-stride path) — the §2.3 regression sentinel for pointer-backing.
- **Baselines recorded**: see the Appendix.
- **Deliverable:** agreed direction + the test/bench suite + the map-value fix merged to `master`.

### Stage 1 — All-scalar records: promote the sealed struct to the sole representation

The semantic flip — riskiest per line, smallest blast radius (scalar-only records).

- `lin-ir/src/repr.rs`: for all-scalar records **not flowing into `Json`/`AnyVal`** (D8), the oracle
  answer becomes constant-Packed; delete the boxed arms for this class.
- **Arrays switch from inline-stride to pointer-backed**: stop emitting `lin_sealed_array_alloc`
  (inline payloads) for record elements (`lin-codegen/codegen/mod.rs` array-literal path); store
  retained pointers to sealed structs; index = load pointer (no materialize); `push` = retain + append
  (`codegen/data.rs`). This is where the **D5 test flips** for all-scalar arrays.
- **D3 lands here**: `lin-ir/src/monomorphize.rs` — extend `SpecKey` with the concrete argument record
  layout for anonymous-structural *parameters* (the machinery already specialises per-generic and
  per-callback); canonical layout per anonymous shape + **project-copy at every non-parameter slot**
  (array element, record field, map value, return, stored closure) — the §7.2 #5 tests flip here.
- §5.7 cross-form equality verified (sealed-vs-boxed `emit_eq` for transitional `AnyVal` flows).
- Measure the scan microbench → **decision point**: promote §5.6 into the plan, or accept.
- Exit: full gate; `records` bench unchanged or better.

### Stage 2 — Heap-field records: same promotion, unconditional (largest payoff)

- Delete the packability gates (`is_sealed_array_field_packable` and friends, `lin-check/src/types.rs`
  + checker `expr.rs` seal-direction logic): every named/anonymous record becomes a sealed struct
  unconditionally (D8 carve-out aside) — `String`/array/map/nested-record fields as owned-pointer
  slots, const-offset reads.
- `T[]` and `{ String: T }` store sealed pointers; reads return the shared record with **no
  materialization** — retire the `sealed_array_project*` / materialize-on-read paths
  (`codegen/data.rs`, `sealed.rs` rebuild-from-boxed) for this class.
- This is where RAPTOR's read seam **and** regroup copy die. Re-measure RAPTOR (digest per D5 rule;
  expect PREP and query improvements; sealed_alloc count should collapse).

### Stage 3 — Unions of records: tagged value + `match` narrows representation

- `T | Null` → nullable sealed pointer (one word); `A | B` → tag + payload-pointer; `match … is T`
  reads the payload at `T`'s known layout — generalise the SumNode tag-switch (ADR-064) instead of
  re-projecting (`codegen/match.rs`, `lin-ir` lower).
- Deletes the `Conn = Boarding | Transfer` / `Trip | Null` seam. Re-measure RAPTOR query phases.

### Stage 4 — Repoint Perceus/`rc_elide` (now load-bearing for parity, not just upside)

- Pointer-backed arrays **add** retain/release traffic vs the retired inline-stride form — borrow-based
  RC elision (`lin-ir/src/rc_elide.rs`) is what claws that back; plus reuse-in-place for dead sealed
  buffers (cuts allocator traffic on construct-heavy paths).
- Measure RC call counts on RAPTOR/records before vs after.

### Stage 5 — Uniformity audit

- Verify every container path (array, map, union, closure capture, worker transfer) stores/returns
  shared sealed pointers with no residual materialize sites: grep the emitted IR of the benchmark
  corpus for `lin_sealed_alloc`/materialize calls — counts should be construction-only.

### Stage 6a — `AnyVal` refounding + `LinObject` deletion (runtime/compiler)

- `AnyVal` = the tagged-union machinery; record case carries **sealed pointer + descriptor** (D4,
  shares — no deep conversion); index/field access dispatches on tag; `is T` = **descriptor structural
  walk** with identity fast path (§5.8).
- Delete `object.rs`'s string-keyed storage + `lin_object_get` scan; descriptors stay and drive
  equality/display/`fromJson`/worker deep-copy/serialization (D7).
- Ordered-map container (linked hashmap) for §2.6; `keys`/`values`/`entries` narrowed to
  hashmaps/`AnyVal` (D6).
- Retire the D8 transitional boxed shadow — `repr.rs` is now a pure layout calculator.

### Stage 6b — The `.lin` migration (wide, parallelizable)

- `Json → AnyVal` rename across the checker surface, stdlib, examples, benchmarks, docs-site.
- **Retire-`AnyVal` typing pass**: most values currently typed `Json` get precise types (records,
  hashmaps, unions) module-by-module — this executes the D2 ambition and is fan-out-able (one agent
  per stdlib module / example project, each holding the full gate).
- Ordered-map adoptions where insertion order was load-bearing (RAPTOR `getQueue`, etc.).
- This stage carries the §7.2 visible-change surface; isolating it last keeps Stages 1–5 as close to
  digest-stable as D5 allows.

### Optional (promoted if the Stage-1 microbench demands) — inline-array layout (§5.6)

### Closing work — write the spec to match what was built (implement-then-document)

- **Now** write the authoritative docs against the *as-built* design: `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` (records
  are value-layout/reference-semantics; `AnyVal` replaces `Json`; the §5.3 structural-parameter rule;
  the five behaviour changes), a new ADR superseding/annotating ADR-062, `docs/STDLIB.md`
  (`AnyVal`/`keys` surface), and `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` (remove the "inherent PREP copy" caveat — §2.4).
  Reconcile D1–D8 with whatever the implementation actually settled on; the as-built behaviour is
  authoritative, the decisions list is updated to match.
- Re-measure RAPTOR typed vs Go.

## 7. Success criteria, risks, and the breaking change

### 7.1 Success criteria

There is no longer a "typed vs `Json`" race for the same data: typed → record (fast); untyped →
`AnyVal` (slow, by choice). So:

- **Typed RAPTOR approaches Go**, not "approaches the Json port." Expect a small residual constant from
  per-record pointer indirection + per-record allocation; the optional inline-array optimization
  (§5.6) closes it for scan-dense code.
- **`AnyVal` is the only slow path, and only when explicitly chosen.**
- The compiler is **smaller**: `repr.rs` reconciliation, `object.rs` string-keyed storage,
  `BoxKeepPacked`, the path-9 machinery all deleted (descriptors kept, D7).

### 7.2 The breaking change — five userland-visible changes (honest count)

1. **`Json → AnyVal` rename** — mechanical but wide (stdlib signatures, examples, docs). `AnyVal` also
   *narrows* the old `Json` (D2, incl. the transitivity rule): code that smuggled a handle through
   `Json` — directly or inside a record field — no longer type-checks and must keep the value
   statically typed.
2. **Insertion-order iteration** moves to an explicit ordered container (§2.6).
3. **`keys`/`values`/`entries` no longer apply to records** (D6) — use a hashmap for dynamic keys.
4. **Aliasing unified to share-always** (D5) — `push`-then-mutate is now consistently visible for the
   previously-packed cases.
5. **Widening into anonymous-structural slots/closures projects like named records** (D3/§5.3) —
   array elements, record fields, map values, returns, and stored-closure arguments of anonymous
   structural type project-copy (drop extra fields, sever sharing) instead of sharing-and-keeping.
   Direct parameters are unaffected (monomorphised — sharing preserved). Likely rare in practice.

Note **passing records to functions and in-place mutation through a parameter are unchanged** — the
reference axis (D1) is preserved. (#4 is about the *array/map element* aliasing, not the parameter;
#5's direct-parameter case is handled by monomorphisation precisely so call sites keep sharing.)

### 7.3 Risks

- **Large change, but subtractive — with the deletion payoff back-loaded.** Touches `lin-check`,
  `lin-ir`, all of `lin-codegen`, and `lin-runtime`. Stages 1–5 are *close to* behaviour-preserving
  (D5 and the rare D3 slot cases are the named exceptions), so the digest + suite are a strong guard.
  Per D8, Stages 1–5 still carry a **scoped flow-sensitive pass** (which records flow into `AnyVal`)
  and the boxed shadow (wrapping the live buffer, never copying) — the `repr.rs`/`object.rs` deletions
  are fully realised only at Stage 6. Budget accordingly: the simplification dividend arrives at the
  end, not per-stage.
- **Width-subtyping over anonymous structural types** (D3) is the subtlest correctness area — the
  stored-closure fallback (project-copy) must be applied uniformly or a heterogeneous-layout call reads
  a wrong offset.
- **The `AnyVal` boundary** must stay a single-direction conversion (D4); reintroducing a reconciliation
  oracle re-opens path-9.
- **Pointer indirection / allocation residual** vs Go's inline arrays — mitigated by §5.6.
- **Scope discipline.** Ship stage-by-stage on `reset/main` (§6 branch policy — `master` only takes
  the project when net-positive); interp's call-cost axis is a separate project.

## 8. The one-sentence version

Stop representing "a record" as a string-keyed JSON object: make a record a pointer to a **flat packed
struct** with constant-offset access (keeping today's **reference** semantics), make dynamic data a
real hashmap or the JSON-shaped **`AnyVal`** value type (no handles, descriptor-carrying boundary),
delete `LinObject`'s string-keyed storage (keep descriptors), and the typed-vs-Go gap closes as a
*consequence* — with five named userland changes and the parameter-passing behaviour you wanted
preserved.

## Appendix: Stage-0 baselines (recorded 2026-06-12, this machine, O2, single run)

The "before" numbers every stage compares against.

**RAPTOR full feed** (digest `group=26203913 range=773022892 journeys=139`, identical for both ports
and re-confirmed after the Stage-0 map-value fix):

| Phase | `Json` port (ms) | typed port (ms) | typed / Json |
|-------|----:|----:|----:|
| LOAD  | 15779 | 17353 | 1.10× |
| PREP  | 28365 | 104264 | 3.67× |
| GROUP | 62040 | 114583 | 1.85× |
| RANGE | 184475 | 334286 | 1.81× |
| total | 290759 | 571086 | **1.96×** |

**Other baselines:**
- `records` cross-language bench: **Lin 200 ms** vs Rust 224 / Go 624 (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` §2).
- `benchmarks/record_array_scan.lin` (the §2.3 inline-stride sentinel): **SCAN ms=12,
  sum=40000100000000** (1M × 3-field records, 20 passes — the sum is the cross-stage correctness
  check; the ms is the cache-locality sentinel).
- Suites: `lin test stdlib/ examples/` = **72/72**; `cargo test --workspace` green (integration
  count grows with the Stage-0 pin suite).
- `lin_sealed_alloc` count on typed RAPTOR: not re-measured at Stage 0 (the known figures —
  299.6M pre-de-materialization, 184.5M with the since-reverted memo — don't match current master
  exactly). **Re-measure at the start of Stage 2**, whose payoff claim ("sealed_alloc collapses to
  construction-only") needs the precise before-number.
